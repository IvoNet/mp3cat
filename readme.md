See the [documentation](http://www.dmulholl.com/dev/mp3cat.html) for details.

This application is in *maintenance mode* --- it's intentionally simple and I'm not planning to add any extra features.
If you need something more complex check out [mp3binder](https://github.com/crra/mp3binder) which is an active fork with additional functionality.
